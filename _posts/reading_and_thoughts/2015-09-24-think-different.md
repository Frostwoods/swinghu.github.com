"Think different" was Apple's advertising slogon in 1997. Apple also brought out a television commercial, known as "Crazy Ones". It was a one-minute black-and-white footage, presenting 17 iconic 20th century personalities. I was moved by the video clip, and those "ones who see things differently".

I like people who think and do things differently. I still remember moments when I read *The Sound and the Fury* in middle school library. It was a gloomy afternoon, the cover of the book was warped and yellowing, words started to get blurred. It was the first time I realized that story can be written from the perspective of a mentally disabled man. That section, which is characterized by a highly disjointed narrative style with frequent chronological leaps, brought me a completely different kind of feeling - strange, nervous. It seemed like the world became wider.
