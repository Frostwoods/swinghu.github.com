title: Dream In Dream And Dali's Destino

In *True Detective*, Rust told Marty, "I don't sleep, I just dream". I think this also describe my experience of my recent days. Dreaming all night long, vivid and detailed dream visuals, restless and exhausted.

Spanish Surrealist painter Dalí once helped Walt Disney Company make a short film *Destino* in 2003.

A bizarre dream, I was convinced. It was in this dream that I first time saw Dalí, on an interview. I can barely recognize his face - because I never saw him. He showed us one of his art work - yeah a painting which I imagined - circles in circles, with different colors. Dalí told us this painting conveyed a message that he wanted to transfer to us that we tiny, humble people should have tolerance.
