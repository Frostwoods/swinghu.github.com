There are many "Chinese characteristics" in China. The household registration,
also known as Hukou system, is one of most controversial things in my country.
Truth be told, I didn't even realize this contradiction several years ago: As a
son of peasant, I nearly could not have the chance to move to middle school in county.
My parents helped me that finally, through "back door". It was far more than that.
I had to apply for household reallocation twice when I went to collage and graduate
school. All of these have everything to do with Hukou.

I once read a paper: [Chan-hukou](http://faculty.washington.edu/kwchan/Chan-hukou.pdf),
 and I found that something is clear if rise it to the theory altitude. One simple summary: all of these come from a political considerations: to make the governing easier.
