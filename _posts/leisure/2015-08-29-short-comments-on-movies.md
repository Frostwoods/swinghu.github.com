*Good Will Hunting (1997)*: I particularly like the scene whick Will Hunting goes up and raps on the glass to taunt that Harvard guy, "How do you like them apples?"

For a long time I had always thought this phrase "How do you like them apples" just came from this movie, which wasn't true, however. Same phrase also showed up in an earlier movie *From Dusk Till Dawn*:

*The Bourne I,II,III*: Jason Bourne is cool. Love it!

*The Bourne Legacy (2014)* : Compared to original *The Bourne* trilogy, maybe this one is .. boring?

*重庆森林*:

*Kill Bill (2003)*: I happened to know that the original Volume 1 contains a crazy 88 fight scene - it was so bloody and violent that Quentin Tarantino had to make the famous fight scene black and white. You can check out on this: <br /> [https://thepiratebay.la/torrent/8028488/KILL_BILL__THE_WHOLE_BLOODY_AFFAIR_hd-720p_DTS](https://thepiratebay.la/torrent/8028488/KILL_BILL__THE_WHOLE_BLOODY_AFFAIR_hd-720p_DTS)

*Reservoir Dogs (1992)*: "Alright ramblers, let’s get rambling!"

*Fight Club (1999)*: "Self-improvement is masturbation. And self-destruction."

(2014-08-23) *[REC] 4: Apocalipsis (2014)*:

(2014-10-18) *Cool Hand Luke*: "What we've got here, is a failure to communicate --"

*The Sting*:

*Road To perdition*:

(2014-11-16) *Interstellar*:

*Cashback (2006)* : Heard that the same name short clip won some awards. But this one is boring.
The good news is: really many UNNECESSARY nudity scenes.

*Rashômon (1950)* : My cousin, who is twelve years younger than me, asked me to watch this movie with him. And I slept half of the time while watching.

(2015-03-21) *Whiplash*:

(2015-03-31) *Kingsman: The Secret Service (2014)*: Colin Firth is gentle and cool, that church fight scene is awesome and cool. And I like *Free bird* even more.

(2015-05-03) *Furious 7*:

(2015-06-08) *Mr. Brooks (2007)*:

(2015-06-20) *鍵泥棒のメソッド (2012)*: Well, I found *香川 照之* is a bit like *Kevin Spacey*. Both are my favorite actors.

(2015-06-26) *This Is The End(2013)*:

*Birdman (2014)*: I didn't realize this movie was shot in ONE TAKE - at lease that was what it looked like. Indeed, this is incredible awesome! Filmmaking tour de force! The insight, the direction, and the cinematography, all superb. If you haven't seen it yet now it is a must!

(2015-07-22) *Under the Skin*:

(2015-09-06) *Cronocrímenes, Los(Timecrimes) (2007)*: The story line is just like *Triangle*, but I have to say it is not so good as *Triangle*. And I found that this type of movies has its inevitable limitation: it has to use some kind of "wrap-around bandage" to make the whole story self-justified. It is easy to feel bored if watch this kind of movies two or more.

(2015-09-18) *Spy (2015)*: Just a popcorn movie. What impress me most is that bunch of British dirty languages..

(2015-09-20) *Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation (2015)*: The most exciting movie scene - Tom Cruise's insane plane stunt - appeared very early in the beginning of movie. Then what? A guy sitting next to me was found sleep during the second half. You can't blame him, I am pretty sure he is not the only person who agree the point that the second half of the movie is somewhat less exciting.

(2015-09-26) *Dallas Buyers Club (2013)*:

(2015-09-27) *Nebraska (2013)*:

(2015-10-03) *Argo (2012)*: A report on CIA website: [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html](https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/winter99-00/art1.html).  <br />
Another interesting story behind the movie: *When ‘Argo’ Was Called ‘Lord of Light’*:  <br /> [http://www.slashfilm.com/when-argo-was-called-lord-of-light/](http://www.slashfilm.com/when-argo-was-called-lord-of-light/).  <br />
ARGO FUCK YOURSELF!

(2015-10-04) *Perfume: The Story of a Murderer*: Fucking disgusting and stupid. Can't believe I just wasted two and half hours to watch this value-distorted trash.

(2015-10-12) *Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)*:

(2015-10-19) *黑社会(2005), 黑社会II:以和为贵 (2006)*

(2015-10-21) *South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut (1999)*:

![](/assets/leisure/short-comments-on-movies/South_Park_Bigger_Longer_&_Uncut_1999.jpg)

(2015-10-30) *The Life of David Gale (2003)*

(2015-10-31) *Ant-Man (2015)*

(2015-10-31) *From Dusk Till Dawn (1996)*

(2015-12-01) *P.K. (2014)*

(2015-12-06) *Nightcrawler (2014)*: So now, Jake Gyllenhaal join the long list of stars who drop dramatic amounts
of weight for their movies. Former stars including Charlize Theron in "Monster", Christian Bale in "The machinist", 
Matthew McConaughey in "Dallas Buyers Club", etc. 
Obviously many people would argue that it's naïve – and dangerous – for Jake and other celebrities 
to think rapidly fluctuating weight is good preparation for a movie role - After all, 
you can use CGI to make your look malnourished and stick thin as you like. 
Maybe it is what we called Method Acting: Actors need to embrace the characters they are studying to 
communicate their commitment to the role. 
Understanding the implications of what they're doing is equally as important.
