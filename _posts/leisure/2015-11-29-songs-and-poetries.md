## Scarborough Fair

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  <br />
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  <br />
Remember me to the one who lives there,  <br />
For once she was a true love of mine.  <br />

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt,  <br />
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  <br />
Without any seam or needlework,  <br />
Then she shall be a true love of mine.  <br />

Tell her to wash it in yonder well,  <br />
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  <br />
Where never sprung water or rain ever fell,  <br />
And she shall be a true lover of mine.  <br />

Tell her to dry it on yonder thorn,  <br />
Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme;  <br />
Which never bore blossom since Adam was born,  <br />
Then she shall be a true lover of mine.  <br />

# Poetries

## Invictus

Out of the night that covers me,  <br />
Black as the Pit from pole to pole,  <br />
I thank whatever gods may be  <br />
For my unconquerable soul.  <br />

In the fell clutch of circumstance  <br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud.  <br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance  <br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed.  <br />

Beyond this place of wrath and tears  <br />
Looms but the Horror of the shade,  <br />
And yet the menace of the years  <br />
Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.  <br />

It matters not how strait the gate,  <br />
How charged with punishments the scroll.  <br />
I am the master of my fate:  <br />
I am the captain of my soul.   <br />

## I like for you to be still

I like for you to be still， it is as though you were absent,    <br />
and you hear me from far away， and my voice does not touch you.     <br />
It seems as though your eyes had flown away     <br />
and it seems that a kiss had sealed your mouth.    <br />
As all things are filled with my soul    <br />
you emerge from the things, filled my soul.    <br />
You are like my soul, a butterfly of dream,    <br />
and you are like the word Melancholy.    <br />

I like for you to be still， and you seem far away.    <br />
It sounds as though you were lamenting, a butterfly cooinglike a dove.    <br />
And you hear me from far away and you voice does not rouch you:    <br />
Let me come to be still in your silence.    <br />
And let me talk to you with your silence    <br />
that is brightas a lamp,simple as a ring.    <br />
You are like the night, with it\'s stillness and constellations.    <br />
Your silence is that of a star, as remore and candid.    <br />

I like for you to be still， it is as though you were absent,    <br />
distant anf fullof sorrow as though you had died.    <br />
One word then,one smile,is enough.    <br />
And I am happy, happy that it's not true.    <br />
