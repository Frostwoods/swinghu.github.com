**CD review: Enya, ‘Dark Sky Island’**

**Enya’s ‘Dark Sky Island’: Review Revue**

“It’s amazing how timeless Enya’s sound is: Above a whimsical mix of Celtic and New Age-revival, 
her ethereal vocals float through the songs like clouds through the skies.”


“That timeless sensation is intensified by Enya, her quicksilver soprano layered to the moon, singing of elemental things — the ocean, the sky, the stars, the human heart — which proves both pleasurable and mildly problematic.

After all, if there is an illusion of constancy, is she basically making the same music over and over again?”

**IMO**

if you’re looking for a bit of musical respite in these distressing times the globe we inhabit is wrapped up in, this just might be it.
