**CD review: Enya, ‘Dark Sky Island’**

**Enya’s ‘Dark Sky Island’: Review Revue**

“It’s amazing how timeless Enya’s sound is: Above a whimsical mix of Celtic and New Age-revival, 
her ethereal vocals float through the songs like clouds through the skies.”


“That timeless sensation is intensified by Enya, her quicksilver soprano layered to the moon, singing of elemental things — the ocean, the sky, the stars, the human heart — which proves both pleasurable and mildly problematic.

After all, if there is an illusion of constancy, is she basically making the same music over and over again?”

And now, the end is near; 而今，结局已近  
And so I face the final curtain. 帷幕就要落下  
My friend, I’ll say it clear, 朋友，请听我细细讲  
I’ll state my case, of which I’m certain. 那一切还铭记在心的事情  
I’ve lived a life that’s full. 我曾过着充实的生活  
I’ve traveled each and every highway; 曾经飞驰在高速公路上，四处旅行  
And more, much more than this, 但比这更重要的是  
I did it my way. 我走自己的路  

Regrets, I’ve had a few; 遗憾，也曾有过一些  
But then again, too few to mention. 但少的不足提起  
I did what I had to do 我做了我应该做的  
And saw it through without exemption. 即便一切重来，我也不会改变  

I planned each charted course; 我曾计划好每一次行程  
Each careful step along the byway, 还有偏僻小道的每一小步  
Oh, and more, much more than this, 但比这更重要的是  
I did it my way. 我走自己的路  

Yes, there were times, I’m sure you knew 是的，有那么几次，你也清楚  
When I bit off more than I could chew. 我有些贪多不嚼烂  
But through it all, when there was doubt, 但每一次稍有犹豫  
I ate it up and spit it out. 我都会毫不保留的将一切咽下  
I faced it all and I stood tall; 我昂首面对  
And did it my way. 走自己的路  

I’ve loved, I’ve laughed and cried. 我曾爱过，曾大声的笑过，哭过  
I’ve had my fill; my share of losing. 曾满足过，也曾失败过  
And now, as tears subside, 现在，泪水已干  
I find it all so amusing. 我发现一切如此的好笑  

To think I did all that; 想想我曾做过的一切  
And may I say - not in a shy way, 我可以说，毫无羞愧的  
No, oh no not me, 这没有什么了不起的  
I did it my way. 我只是，走了自己的路  

For what is a man, what has he got? 人到底为何而活，活着又得到了些什么？  
If not himself, then he has naught. 如果不是自己，那他便虚度此生  
To say the things he truly feels; 说出自己的真实想法  
And not the words of one who kneels. 永不屈就说不情愿的话  
The record shows I took the blows - 这盒录音带记录我所走过的不平和坎坷  
And did it my way 我走的，是自己的路
